			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>This is a "Bingo" board for Super Mario World races.</p>
			<p>To win, you must complete 5 of the tasks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
			<p>The seed number is used to generate the board. Changing the seed will make a new board.</p>
			<p>You can click on the squares to turn them green and red. This may help you organize your route planning.</p>
			
			<p><strong>RULES:</strong></p>
			<!--
			<p><strong>NORMAL BINGO</strong> - You must KILL BOWSER after completing your 5 goals.  Take any route to Bowser's castle.  Timing ends when the last mecha-koopa hits Bowser.</p>

			<p><strong>SHORT BINGO</strong> - You DO NOT need to kill Bowser.  Timing ends when you complete the last goal.
			If the last goal is an exit, timing ends when you touch that exit bar or keyhole.  If the
			last goal is a boss, timing ends when the whistle blows.  If the last goal is an item, such
			as a moon or 1-up, timing ends when you touch that item.</p>

			<p><strong>Rules for all Bingo versions:</strong></p>
			-->
			
			<ul>
			<li>You must KILL BOWSER after completing your 5 goals.  Take any route to Bowser's castle.  Timing ends when the last mecha-koopa hits Bowser.</li>
			
			<li>For goals that don't require you to beat the level (e.g. moons, bonus rooms, coins), you
			may die or start-select to leave the stage once your objective is obtained.</li>

			<li>For goals that require you to beat a level but don't say which exit to use, you may use either exit.</li>

			<li>For "no yoshi" goals if you enter a level with yoshi you must hop off him immediately.  
			Carrying a baby yoshi is allowed.</li>

			<li>For "small mario" goals, if you grab a powerup you must get hit by the first available enemy.  If you enter
			a level as large mario you must get hit by the first enemy.  If you hit a midway gate you
			must kill mario.</li>

			<li>For "no flying" goals, you may float with the cape.  You may NOT jump to a height that exceeds mario's normal 
			running jump (without cape), and you may not do the "cape bounce" move (i.e pressing back on the d-pad while mario 
			is in flying mode).  You may not fly with yoshi.</li>

			<li>For "no cape" goals if you collect a cape, or if you begin the level with a cape, you must get hit by the first available enemy.</li>

			<li>You can not repeat the same stage multiple times to accomplish the same goal.  For
			example: getting the same moon or defeating the same reznor repeatedly.</li>

			<li>"Ghost house exits" - Can take 2 different exits from a single house.  Can not reuse the 
			same exit.  Donut Secret House counts as a ghost house, but Sunken Ghost Ship does not.</li>

			<li>"Bonus rooms" - These are the vertical rooms with several levels where you have to get
			three O's to get 1-up.   You do not need to go thru the bonus room or hit any of the blocks.
			You can just leave from the lower pipe.</li>

			<li>"Bonus game" - This is the 9-block matching game (100 stars).  Get all 9 blocks the same.</li>

			<li>"Star-block 1-ups" - These are the green blocks with the star on them (aka Bonus Blocks).
			You need to collect 30 coins in the level before hitting it to gain a 1-up.</li>

			<li>"Hidden 1-ups" - These are 1-ups that appear when you run by a certain spot.  
			You must collect the 1-up.  You can only get 1 hidden 1-up per stage.</li>

			<li>"Multi-powerup blocks" - These are the transparent blocks that 
			cycle through different powerups.  You must grab the star from it.</li>

			<li>"1-up from pink-berry cloud" - Eat 2 pink berries with yoshi to make a cloud appear.  
			Collect all the coins dropped by the cloud to make a 1-up appear.  You must collect the 1-up.</li>

			<li>"Mushroom from red berries" - Eat 10 red berries with yoshi to make a mushroom appear.  
			You must collect the mushroom.  
			(If you are also doing a "small mario" goal for that stage you must get hit immediately after collecting the mushroom.)</li>

			<li>"Pacifist" - You can not kill, damage, or stun any enemies.  You are allowed to spin-jump on
			enemies that do not react to it, and you may jump on such enemies with yoshi.  
			If you break the rules you must kill mario.  
			Popping bubbles is allowed (even if the enemy inside drops into a pit).</li>

			<li>"Coinless" - You must begin at the start of the level (not the midway gate).  
			If you collect a coin or yoshi coin you must kill mario.  
			If you already touched the midway gate before collecting any coins, you are allowed to continue from the midway gate.  
			Any exit is allowed, unless the goal states otherwise.</p>

			<li>"Beat FOI 4 without getting Lakitu 1-up; no flying" - If you touch the 1-up offered by Lakitu you must
			kill mario or start-select to exit the level.</li>

			<li>"All exits in Forest Of Illusion" - there are 14 exits total:<br/>
			FOI1(a,b), FOI2(a,b), FOI3(a,b), FOI4(a,b), Ghost House (a,b), Forest secret area, Fortress,
			Castle 5, Blue Switch</li>

			<li>"X swimming stages" - Any exit is acceptable.  See list below for which stages are considered swimming stages 
			(i.e. those that contain water up to the ceiling somewhere).</li>

			<li>The Sunken Ghost Ship counts as part of Valley Of Bowser.</li>

			<li>"300 coins on Yellow Switch" - You should be BIG mario for this.  There is no way to replay
			this level if you fail (besides waiting for the timer to run out), so you may wish to save
			right before attempting this so that you can reset if you fail.  For example you could play
			World 1 in this order:  YI1, YI2, YI3, YI4, Castle 1, Yellow Switch.</li>

			<li>TIP: When flying with yoshi, if you want to prevent yoshi from swallowing the shell you can
			periodically land, HOLD DOWN while spitting out the shell, and then re-eat it.</li>

			<li>TIP: "Cheese Bridge - coinless" - To get past the yellow pipe (after midway gate) do a non-pspeed 
			running jump of full height from the right edge of the preceding wooden platform.  Do not land on the the yellow pipe.</li>
