DESIGN NOTES:
* All bingo games end with killing Bowser.  Take any route to Bowser's castle.
* Expected time should be between 45 minutes and 90 minutes.
* Ordering of the goals within a category is (supposed to be) in increasing order of the
  amount of time it adds to the run, using the standard any%-no-star-world route as a
  baseline.  For challenge goals it is good to also consider the cost of failure and
  the rate of failure you'd expect for an average player).
* The "Game-length Goal" ensures that all rows/cols will involve completing a
  significant portion of the game.  Ideally we want some routes to reach bowser through
  the star-world and other routes to reach bowser through world 7, without giving a huge
  advantage to either one.
* The "Main Task" and "Collecting Task" are flexible goals that can be varied to suit
  the rest of the route.  The "Challenge" goals are meant to add some difficulty and
  open up different parts of the map.

TO DO:
* The order of the goals in all categories needs sorting (by amount of time to complete).
* Needs more goals in the "game-length" category (things that require you to go
  past world 5, do something far into special world, etc).
		
POTENTIAL GOALS
* Beat [some hard stage] as small mario, no yoshi
* Collect [XX] coins in [stage]
* Collect zero coins in [stage]
* Beat [stage] without harming any enemies
* Get time [XXX] or greater on [stage]
* Beat [stage] with [blue/yellow/red] yoshi (this could be used as a game-length goal)
* More game-length-enforcing goals (i.e. ways to encourage players to open up different
  areas in FOI, CI, and VOB)
